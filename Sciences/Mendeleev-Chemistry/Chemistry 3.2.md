## Calculating concentration in g/dm続
- When you dissolve a mass of solute in a solvent you can express the concentration of the solution that you have made in grams per decimetre cubed (g/dm続)
- You can calculate the value using the equation:  
$$ \text{Concentration (g/dm続)} = \frac{\text{Mass of solute (g)}}{\text{Volume of solution (dm続)}} $$
