## Definition
**Enthalpy change of combustion,  $\Delta H_c^\ominus$  **
+ The energy change that takes place when **1 mole** of a substance in its **standard state** is **fully combusted in oxygen**.
**Enthalpy change of formation, $\Delta H_f^\ominus$**
- The energy change that takes place when **1 mole** of a compound is **formed from its constituent elements in their standard states**.
**Average/Mean bond enthalpy**
- The energy needed for **1 mole** of a given type of bonds in a gaseous compound to undergo **homolytic fission** under **standard conditions**, **averaged across a range of compounds**.
