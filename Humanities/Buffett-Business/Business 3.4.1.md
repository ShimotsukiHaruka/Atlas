## The Purpose of Final Accounts
+ All businesses have to keep detailed records of purchases, sales and other financial transactions. 
+ Accounts are financial records of business transactions, which are needed to provide essential information to groups both within and outside the business. 
+ While proper accounting lets managers have better financial control and planning, it can also be a legal requirement. 
+ All companies (businesses owned by shareholders) must provide a set of final accounts to their various stakeholders.
## The Purpose of Final Accounts
These accounts consist of two statements:
- Profit and loss account (income statement)
- Statement of financial position (balance sheet)
- It shows the trading position of a business at the end of a specified accounting period.
- It shows the assets and liabilities of a business at a particular point in time.
