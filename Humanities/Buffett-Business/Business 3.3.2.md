## Average Total Cost
- Average Cost (AC) or Average Total Cost (ATC) is the cost per unit of output.
- (Remember 'average' means 'per unit' and so will involve dividing the particular cost by the total output produced. In the graphs here you will notice that the average variable costs and average total costs first fall and then start rising. This is because of economies of scale and diseconomies of scale respectively. As the firm increases its output, the average costs decline but as it starts growing beyond a limit, the average costs rise.
$$Average \ Total \ Cost \ (ATC) = \frac{Total \ Cost \ (TC) }{Total \ Output}$$
$$Average \ Cost \ (AC) = Average \ Variable \ Cost \ (AVC) + Average \ Fixed\  Cost\ (AFC)$$
## Calculations
- Suppose a TV manufacturer produces 1000 TVs a month. The firm’s fixed costs in rent is $900, and variable cost per unit is $500. What would its TFC, TVC, AVC, AFC, AC and TC be, in a month?
- No. of units of TVs produced = 1000
- Total Fixed Costs for one month = $900
- Average Fixed Cost = $900 / 1000 = $0.9 per unit
- Variable Cost of producing one unit of TV = $500
- Total Variable Costs for producing 1000 TVs in a month = $500 * 1000 = $500,000
- Average Variable Cost = $500,000 / 1000 = $500 (AVC is the same as VC per unit!)
- Total Costs = Total Fixed Costs + Total Variable Costs ==> $900 + $500,000 = $500,900
- Average Costs = Total Costs / Total Output ==> $500,900 / 1000 = $500.9
## Indirect Costs & Direct Costs
+ The terms indirect costs and direct costs are used when referring to businesses that produce or sell a range of products and therefore operate 'cost center's and 'profit centers' (see Unit 3.9).
+ These cost can be either fixed or variable costs, depending on the nature of the business.
### Cost Centre (TC) VS Profit Centre (TC+TR)
+ **Cost only:**  Minimize cost  
   + Ex: Production division  
   + Add in cost control
+ **Cost and revenue:** Maximize profit
   + Ex: Sales division  
   + Add in overall profitability
