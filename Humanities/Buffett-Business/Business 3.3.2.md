## Average Total Cost
- Average Cost (AC) or Average Total Cost (ATC) is the cost per unit of output.
- (Remember 'average' means 'per unit' and so will involve dividing the particular cost by the total output produced. In the graphs here you will notice that the average variable costs and average total costs first fall and then start rising. This is because of economies of scale and diseconomies of scale respectively. As the firm increases its output, the average costs decline but as it starts growing beyond a limit, the average costs rise.
$$Average \ Total \ Cost \ (ATC) = Total \ Cost \ (TC) / Total \ Output$$
$$Average \ Cost \ (AC) = Average \ Variable \ Cost \ (AVC) + Average \ Fixed\  Cost\ (AFC)$$
