## Calculate
**How do you calculate yield?**

- We apply this as a means to determine the efficiency of a reaction.

$$ \% \text{ Yield} = \frac{\text{Experimental Yield}}{\text{Theoretical Yield}} \times 100\% $$

**Steps:**
1) Find the experimental yield in the question.
2) Calculate theoretical yield (FIND MASS OF PRODUCT).
3) Apply values to the calculation above.
