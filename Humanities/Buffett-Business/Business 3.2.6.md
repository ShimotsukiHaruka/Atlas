## The Expected Timescale
- Short-term sources of finance are needed for a limited period of time, normally less than one year.
- Long-term sources of finance are those that are needed over a longer period of time, usually over a year.

## The Business's Legal Structure

## The Cost of the Source of Finance
**The costs incurred by firms raising financial capital can take a number of forms:**
+ The interest rate charged will depend on the level of risk that the loan represents to the lender and the firm, period of the loan, as well as the approval of the loan. E.g. a short-term term to a high-risk business might be charged at a high rate of interest.
+ The costs of selling shares: For a publicly held company, a share issue can be an expensive method of raising capital, as it entails considerable administration and promotion costs and, on occasions, insurance costs in case the sale is not successful.
+ The opportunity cost in terms of what has to be given up as a consequence of the decision. E.g. receiving trade credit from a supplier may be attractive, but it carries a possible opportunity cost in that the supplier may charge a higher selling price because it is, in effect, providing an interest-free, short-term loan.
## The Need to Retain Control
**Some sources of finance may result in the original owners of the business losing some, or even complete control of it, namely:**
- Share capital: If a private or publicly held company makes a succession of share issues, it may be that the number of new shares issued is greater than the number of 'original' shares. In this case, the new shareholders may gain control of the company. However, it may be possible for the company to issue shares that do not carry full voting rights to retain control, but this is less attractive for potential investors.
- Business angels: smaller businesses that do not trade as companies can also lose some degree of control. E.g. business angels may only agree to provide finance to what may be a risky business if they have a say in how the business is managed, meaning owning shares/equity that gives them voting rights.
