## External Economies Of Scale
**Access to skilled workers:** Large firms can recruit workers trained by other firms. For example, when a new training institution for pilots and airline staff opens, all airline firms can enjoy economies of scale from having access to skilled workers, who are more efficient and productive, which helps to cut costs.

**Ancillary firms:** These are specialized firms that provide better quality and cheaper goods/services to larger firms, which helps firms to cut costs. E.g., Ancillary firms may operate in logistics, finance & accounting, audit, IT, etc.

**Joint marketing benefits:** When firms in the same industry locate close to each other, they may share an enhanced reputation and customer base.

**Shared infrastructure:** Developments in the infrastructure of an industry or an economy can benefit large firms. Examples: more roads and bridges built by the government can cut transport costs for firms; a new power station can provide cheaper electricity for firms.

**Specialist markets:** Some large industries have specialist selling places and arrangements such as eyewear markets, electronics markets, factory outlets, shopping malls, etc.

## Internal Diseconomies of Scale
**Difficulties controlling the firm:** Management becomes more complex in a large firm. Too many layers of management will increase administrative costs and make the firm slower in responding to changes in market conditions.

**Communication problems:** It can be difficult to ensure that every worker in a large firm has full knowledge about their duties and alternative possibilities.

**Motivation problems:** Large firms may be at a greater risk from a lack of motivation of workers, strikes and other industrial action. This is because workers may not have a sense of belonging, may become less cooperative, so more conflicts may arise due to the presence of diverse opinions, which incurs costs.

## External Diseconomies Of Scale
**Congestion:** With more and more large firms in an area, there will be an increase in traffic with more vehicles bringing in workers and raw materials, and picking up workers and finished products. The heavy traffic will increase journey times, cause higher transport costs and reduce workers' productivity.

**Competition for resources:** Competition for resources will lead to a rise in the cost of factors of production, namely rent, capital equipment and labour wages.

**Disputes and conflicts:** More shares sold and bought in the market means more owners in the business. Having a lot of shareholders can lead to a lot of disputes and conflicts in making key decisions.
