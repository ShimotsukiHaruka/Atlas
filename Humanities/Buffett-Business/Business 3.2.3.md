## Loan Capital ~ Bank Loans  
These are long-term sources of finance obtained from commercial lenders such as banks and other financiers/lenders. Examples include bank loans, market fees, debentures.  
- Bank loans are loans where interest charges are incurred, which can be fixed or variable, depending on the agreement between borrower and lender.  
- The amount borrowed is paid back in installments over a predetermined and agreed period of time, such as 5, 10 or 25 years (inflexible once agreed).  
- If the bank lending the capital considers the loan in any way risky then it may charge a higher interest rate.  
- Banks will often require security/collateral for their loans to mitigate the risks. If the business defaults on the loan by not making repayments, the bank can sell the property or other assets held as collateral in order to recoup the money that was lent.
