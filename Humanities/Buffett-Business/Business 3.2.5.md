## Leasing
**Advantages:**
- Cash released from leasing rather than purchasing can be used for the expenses within the business.
- Another benefit to the lessee is that repairs and maintenance are the responsibility of the lessor.
- Spending on leased assets is classed as a business expense, the tax bill of the lessee is reduced.

**Disadvantages:**
- In the long term, leasing is more expensive than hire purchase (effectively owning the asset after paying in installments over 12 or 24 months) or the outright purchase of the assets.
## Microfinance Providers
- Microfinance is a type of financial service aimed at entrepreneurs of small businesses, especially low and very low income clients.
- It includes other basic financial services such as savings, insurance and the transfer of money from high-income to lower-income countries.
- Microfinance providers enable the disadvantaged members of society to gain access to essential financial services to help eradicate poverty.
- The funds are approved for microenterprise development since access to banking and insurance services may be very limited for small businesses.
