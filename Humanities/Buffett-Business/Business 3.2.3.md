## Loan Capital ~ Bank Loans  
These are long-term sources of finance obtained from commercial lenders such as banks and other financiers/lenders. Examples include bank loans, market fees, debentures.  
- Bank loans are loans where interest charges are incurred, which can be fixed or variable, depending on the agreement between borrower and lender.  
- The amount borrowed is paid back in installments over a predetermined and agreed period of time, such as 5, 10 or 25 years (inflexible once agreed).  
- If the bank lending the capital considers the loan in any way risky then it may charge a higher interest rate.  
- Banks will often require security/collateral for their loans to mitigate the risks. If the business defaults on the loan by not making repayments, the bank can sell the property or other assets held as collateral in order to recoup the money that was lent.
## Loan Capital ~ Mortgages

- A mortgage is a secured loan solely for the purchase of land or buildings, which will be used as a collateral for the loan. If the borrower defaults on the loan (fails to repay) then the lender can repossess/seize (take back) the property.
- Mortgages can be for a long period of time (up to 50 years).
- Some small businesses may choose to remortgage their premises/property to raise capital.
- A remortgage is the process of paying off one mortgage with the proceeds from a new mortgage using the same property as security/collateral while staying with the same lender. This may be done to reduce monthly payments, secure a better interest rate or shorten the time it will take to pay back.
##  Loan Capital ~ Debenture (No need for collateral)

- A debenture is a special type of long-term loan to be repaid at some future date, normally within 15 years. Debenture holders (individuals, governments or other businesses) receive interest payments before shareholders are paid any dividend and even if the business makes a loss.
**Advantages:**
- Unlike shareholders, debenture holders do not usually have ownership or voting rights.
- Debentures provide a long-term source of finance, without the business losing any control.
**Disadvantages:**
- Issuing debentures increases a firm’s **gearing (Unit3.6)**. This means the firm has more borrowing as a percentage of its capital employed.
- This raises interest payments to the lender and increases the firm’s exposure to risk if interest rates increase.
