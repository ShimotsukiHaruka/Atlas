## Business Objectives & Functional Objectives
+ A corporate objective is a target set for the business as a whole.
+ A functional objective is a target for one of the functions of the business, such as marketing, finance, operations or human resources.

$$Corporate \ objectives \rightarrow Departmental \ objectives \rightarrow Individual \ objectives$$

+ For example, if the overall business objective is to increase profits by 30% over the next five years, then during that time, functional objectives would be that:
+ the marketing department may increase sales by 40%.
+ the operations department may reduce costs by 20%.
+ the human resources department may have a target to increase labour productivity by 8%.
+ Similarly, the individual objectives would be that the manager in charge of sales for Guangdong may be asked to increase sales in their area by 30%.

## Private Sector Objectives: Profit Maximisation
+ Profit is the income of a business from its activities after deducting total costs from total revenue.
$$Total \ Profit = Total \ Revenue - Total \ Costs$$
+ Profit are required for further investment into the business as well as for the payment of returns/dividends to shareholders/owners of the business.
+ Profit maximisation means producing at the level of output where the positive difference between total revenue and total costs is greatest.
+ Firms aim to maximise profits by either minimising costs or maximising  revenue, or both.

## Private Sector Objectives: Survival
+ When a business just starts, it has little market power and a low demand, so its initial objective will be just to survive in what can be a very competitive market.
+ **Break even point:** the level of output where total costs equal total revenue.
+ A small firm may be content to just cover its costs (Break-even) until it can become better known by enlarging its customer base.
+ During difficult times when demand is falling due to a shrinking economy/recession, even established large businesses may have survival as their key objective.

## Private Sector Objectives: Growth
+ Expanding sales tend to enable firms to take advantages of a number of internal economics of scale:
  + raising finances more easily.
  + buying raw materials in bulk at discounted rate.
+ By merging with other firms, a business may gain larger market share and competition will be reduces. Increased market share can bring about many benefits such as increased customer loyalty, greater brand awareness, etc.
+ A bigger business may be safer from acquisition by a competitor since it will be more expensive to acquire.
+ A large business can ensure greater job security and improved salaries and benefits for employees.

## Private Sector Objectives: Protecting shareholder value
Managers can protect shareholder value in one of two ways:
+ the value of shares: Shareholders will want their shares price to increase, therefore they'll want growing demand from other investors looking to buy shares. The share price of a business is derived from the perceived quality of the management and its plans, as well as external conditions
+ the dividends paid: Shareholders will interest in the dividends paid each year as well as receive a regular income from their shares in the form of dividends. A business that can pay regular and increasing dividends is likely to be more attractive to investors.
+ **STEEPLE:** Social, Technological, Economic, Environmental, Political, Legal and Ethical factors that affect the business environment.

## Public Sector Objectives: Cash Flow
+ Cash flow is the movement of money into and out of a business over a time period.
+ Cash cycle is the time that elapses between the outflow of cash to pay for the resources needed to produce a product and the receipt of cash following the sale of that product.
+ Businesses in industries such as pharmaceuticals and construction may have long cash cycles.
+ Businesses need to be able to pay debts on time while having enough cash to run their day-to-day operations.
+ In the worst case, a shortage of cash could result in a business having to cease trading.
 A business may have to charge less for a product if a customer pays in cash rather than a deferred payment; this means that that cash flow may improve but profits may fall.

## Public Sector Objectives: Diversification
+ Diversification occurs when a business offers new products and services in new markets, usually in order to benefit from risk-bearing economies of scale.
+ If one becomes obsolete or one market becomes significantly more compitive, then the alternative prodcts or markets will provide a secure source of revenue for the business.
