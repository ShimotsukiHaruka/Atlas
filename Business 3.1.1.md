## Governments As Customers Of Multinationals
Multinational companies can expect to win a number of contracts to help governments in:
- providing **healthcare** (hospitals, medical training, etc...)
- **education** (schools, teacher training, etc...)
- **IT services** (like using digital platforms to collect taxes)
- **infrastructure building** (highways, high-speed trains, bridges, telecom networks, government buildings, etc.)
**For example:**
- Huawei, a Chinese technology company, supplies technology for telecommunication systems infrastructure (5G, fiber optic cables, connectors, etc.) for many countries.
- Government spending in India on IT services reached **$7.7 billion in 2020**, and is expected to rise even more.
