## Share Capital
Share capital is the money raised from selling shares in the company.
A share is simply a certificate giving the holder ownership of part (or a share) of a company.
This is a long-term source of finance, as shown in a firm’s balance sheet (Unit 3.4) mostly for limited liability companies:
- Privately held companies can only sell their shares privately to relatives or friends.
- Publicly held companies can sell their shares to the public via a stock exchange.
The key advantage is that it can provide a huge amount of finance.
The key disadvantage is that it can lead to a loss of control and ownership, and a hostile takeover is very much possible.
## Share Capital (IPO)
Many businesses decide to ‘go public’ by floating their shares on a stock exchange for the first time. This is known as an initial public offering (IPO).
- Popular IPOs are heavily oversubscribed, which pushes up the share price.
- Existing companies can raise further finance by selling more shares in a share placement. However, by issuing shares, it dilutes ownership and control of existing shareholders.
- The process also involves many legalities and administrative procedures, with their associated costs such as hiring the services of specialist financial experts, which can be very expensive.
**IPO:** The process of offering shares of a private corporation to the public in a new stock issuance of publicly listed firms.
## Stock Exchange

- enable existing companies to raise share capital (through a share issue).

- provide a marketplace for trading second-hand shares/stock and other financial instruments such as securities, futures, derivatives, etc...
