## Franchises
+ A franchise is a form of external growth/business ownership whereby a person or business buys a license to trade using another firm's name, logos, brands, trademarks as well as access to material/equipment and training methods.
+ In return for this benefit, the purchaser of a franchise (franchisee) pays a license fee to the parent company of the business (known as the franchisor).
+ The franchisee also pays a royalty payment (such as a commission) which is a percentage based on the sales revenue/turnover of the franchisee.
+ E.g. Subway, 7-Eleven, McDonald's, KFC and Burger King.
+ **Franchise:** A business in which the operator pays a mixture of upfront and ongoing fees in order to license the brand name and supporting resources of a parent company.

- Franchisees benefit from the brand recognition and brand loyalty established by the franchisor.
- Franchisees receive ongoing support and expert advice from the franchisor, such as upskilling training, market research findings, and legal advice.
- Franchisees gain from purchasing economies of scale of the franchisor, rather than facing much higher costs (of inventory, for example) if operating as a sole trader or running a much smaller, independent business.
## Disadvantages For The Franchisor
- The franchisor’s corporate image and brand reputation is at risk if a franchisee is negligent and/or incompetent.
- It is difficult for franchisors to closely monitor the operations of their franchisees.
- The franchisee, as the owner of the franchised outlet, gets to keep most of the profits they generate, as opposed to the franchisor, who gets only a small percentage of revenue.
