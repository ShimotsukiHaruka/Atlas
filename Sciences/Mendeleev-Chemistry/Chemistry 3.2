## Calculating concentration in g/dm続
- When you dissolve a mass of solute in a solvent you can express the concentration of the solution that you have made in grams per decimetre cubed (g/dm続)
- You can calculate the value using the equation:  
**concentration (g/dm続) = amount of substance (g) / volume of solution (dm続)**
