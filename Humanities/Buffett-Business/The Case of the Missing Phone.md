## Part 1: The Problem 
*(About 2.5 minutes)*

**Where:** In the warehouse. Bradford is counting things. Doris is working.

**BRADFORD**  
*(Talking to himself)*  
"Last box of new phones... done writing everything down. Good."  
*(Puts down his papers)*  
Now I can take a short break.

*[Bradford leaves. Doris keeps working. Billy runs in.]*

**BILLY**  
Doris! Bradford! Where are the new phones?  
*(Looking everywhere)*  
I saw them here this morning!

**DORIS**  
*(Stops working)*  
Bradford just finished counting them. He wrote them all down.

**BILLY**  
*(Worried)*  
Well, they're not here now! Doris, you were here alone during break time, right?

**DORIS**  
*(Upset)*  
I was moving the new computers like you told me to. I didn't touch any phones.

**BILLY**  
Sarah said she saw you near these shelves before lunch. That's interesting, don't you think?

**DORIS**  
*(Angry)*  
What are you saying? That I took them?

**BILLY**  
*(Quiet voice)*  
Listen, we don't need to tell everyone. We can fix this ourselves. If you say yes to losing one week's pay, we can forget about it. No police, no problems.

**DORIS**  
*(Very angry)*  
That's not right! And it's against the law! I want to talk to HR! This is not fair!

*[Lights go down]*

## Part 2: Talking About It 
*(About 3 minutes)*

**Where:** Billy's office. All three are there.

**DORIS**  
Bradford, thank you for coming. Billy says I stole something and wants to take my money!

**BRADFORD**  
*(Calmly)*  
Let's all stay calm. Billy, please tell me what happened.

**BILLY**  
*(Angry)*  
We lost expensive phones. Doris was the only person here during break time. Someone saw her near the phones. We need to fix this now!

**BRADFORD**  
I understand, but the company rules are clear. We can't take money without proof. Did you watch the security cameras?

**BILLY**  
*(Not looking happy)*  
Well, no... It takes time to get the camera videos, and I thought...

**BRADFORD**  
*(Stopping him nicely)*  
Then let's do that now. Doris, please tell us what you did during break time.

**DORIS**  
*(Calmer)*  
I was working with computers from 2:00 to 2:45. I only walked past the phones at 2:15. Sarah probably saw me then.

**BRADFORD**  
*(Writing on computer)*  
Thank you. Now let's check the computer records...

*[Lights go down]*

## Part 3: Finding the Truth 
*(About 3.5 minutes)*

**Where:** Office. All three looking at Bradford's computer.

**BRADFORD**  
This is interesting... The computer says we got twenty phones.  
*(Looking at screen)*  
But it says one phone was counted two times... One time as new, another time as old.

**BILLY**  
*(Looking closer)*  
A mistake? But where is the real phone?

**DORIS**  
So maybe the phone is just in the wrong place? Not stolen?

**BRADFORD**  
Let's watch the security cameras.  
*(Clicking computer)*  
Camera three shows the place... There's Doris walking at 2:15, like she said.  
*(Points to screen)*  
Now watch five minutes later...

**BILLY**  
Is that the delivery man?

**BRADFORD**  
Yes. Look... He hits the shelf with his big box, and a small box falls...  
*(Making picture bigger)*  
Right into the cart for old things below!

**DORIS**  
So the phone went to the wrong place by accident!

**BRADFORD**  
*(Standing up)*  
Let me check the cart for old things.  
*(Comes back with small box)*  
And here it is!  
*(Opens box)*  
One phone, still in its box.

**BILLY**  
*(Surprised)*  
It was here all this time? Just a simple mistake...

*[Lights go down]*

## Part 4: Making Things Better 
*(About 2 minutes)*

**Where:** Billy's office. Everyone feels better.

**BILLY**  
*(To Doris, sorry)*  
Doris, I... I don't know what to say. I was wrong. My boss is angry about losing things, and I... I thought the worst too quickly.

**DORIS**  
*(Breathing deeply)*  
Thank you for saying sorry, Billy. But when you said I stole in front of everyone... it hurt me.

**BRADFORD**  
This shows why we need to follow the rules. We will teach all bosses how to check problems properly. No more quick decisions.

**BILLY**  
*(Nodding)*  
You're right. I won't try to be a detective anymore.  
*(Small smile)*  
Next time, I'll check the cameras first.

**DORIS**  
*(Small smile)*  
Well, if you buy me coffee next week, maybe we can be friends again.

**BRADFORD**  
*(Closing computer)*  
Good. The problem is solved. Let's remember to talk and follow rules.

*[All three bow to the people watching as lights go down]*
