## Sources of finance
"If you owe your bank a hundred pounds, you have a problem. But if you owe a million, it has."
## Internal sources of finance
Internal sources of finance come from **within** the business using its own resources. These include:
- Personal funds
- Retained profits
- Sale of assets
## Personal funds
- Sole traders and partners are likely to use their own personal funds from their savings or contract a personal loan in order to finance the start-up of their business.
- Friends and family may invest their personal funds into their business, perhaps in return for part-ownership, which may be organized through the creation of a privately held company and by offering shares to those investing funds.
- Sole traders and partners who do not invest or risk any of their personal funds are highly unlikely to secure loans or finance for their business activity.
