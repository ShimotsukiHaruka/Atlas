## Overdraft
- An overdraft allows a business to temporarily overdraw on its bank account, i.e. to take out more money than it has in its account.
- Overdrafts are commonly used when businesses have minor cash flow problems (Unit 3.7).
- Although overdrafts can demand a relatively high rate of interest, they are usually more cost-effective than bank loans.
- This is because, unlike bank loans, overdrafts are used as short-term sources of finance and interest is charged on a daily basis.
- Overdrafts are suitable when there is a need for a large cash outflow such as:
    - retailers stocking up for peak trading periods.
    - businesses that have sold items on credit and are awaiting payments from their customers.
- However, a major disadvantage of overdrafts is that they are repayable on demand from the financial institution.
- Nevertheless, overdrafts provide flexibility for businesses that might occasionally face cash flow problems.
