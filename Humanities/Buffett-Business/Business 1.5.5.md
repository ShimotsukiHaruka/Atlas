## Advantages For The Franchisee
- Franchisees gain access to a tried and tested business model.
   - **TRIED. TESTED**
- Franchisees benefit from the brand recognition and brand loyalty established by the franchisor.
- Franchisees receive ongoing support and expert advice from the franchisor, such as upskilling training, market research findings, and legal advice.
- Franchisees gain from purchasing economies of scale of the franchisor, rather than facing much higher costs (of inventory, for example) if operating as a sole trader or running a much smaller, independent business.
## Disadvantages For The Franchisor
- The franchisor’s corporate image and brand reputation is at risk if a franchisee is negligent and/or incompetent.
- It is difficult for franchisors to closely monitor the operations of their franchisees.
- The franchisee, as the owner of the franchised outlet, gets to keep most of the profits they generate, as opposed to the franchisor, who gets only a small percentage of revenue.
