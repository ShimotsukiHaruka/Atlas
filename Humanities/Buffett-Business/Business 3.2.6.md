## The Cost of the Source of Finance
**The costs incurred by firms raising financial capital can take a number of forms:**
+ The interest rate charged will depend on the level of risk that the loan represents to the lender and the firm, period of the loan, as well as the approval of the loan. E.g. a short-term term to a high-risk business might be charged at a high rate of interest.
+ The costs of selling shares: For a publicly held company, a share issue can be an expensive method of raising capital, as it entails considerable administration and promotion costs and, on occasions, insurance costs in case the sale is not successful.
+ The opportunity cost in terms of what has to be given up as a consequence of the decision. E.g. receiving trade credit from a supplier may be attractive, but it carries a possible opportunity cost in that the supplier may charge a higher selling price because it is, in effect, providing an interest-free, short-term loan.
