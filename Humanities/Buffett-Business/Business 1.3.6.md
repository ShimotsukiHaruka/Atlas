| Completing a SWOT analysis can be quite simple and quick. | It is rather simplistic and does not demand detailed analysis. |
| It has a wide range of applications, e.g. reacting to the threat of rivals entering the market. | The model is static whereas the business environment is easy changing, so the shell life of a SWOT analysis is rather limited. |
| SWOT analysis helps to determine the organization’s position in the market and therefore adds the formulation of business strategy for its long-term survival. | The analysis is only useful if decision makers are open about the weaknesses and willing to act upon them, i.e. devoting time, people and money to tackling weaknesses and threats. |
| It encourages foresight and proactive thinking in the decision-making process. | SWOT analysis is not typically used in isolation. Better decisions are made if more information is available, so other strategic tools are also used. |
| It can help reduce the risks of decision-making by demanding objective and logical thought processes. | |
