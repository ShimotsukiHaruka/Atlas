## Revenue Streams — Sponsorship Revenue
- Sponsorship is a form of below-the-line promotion (Unit 4.5) whereby the sponsor financially supports an organization in return for prominent promotional display of the donor's brand trademark.
- For example, Arsenal Football Club received a €132 million ($178.4 million) sponsorship deal in 2006, lasting 15 years with Emirates Airlines.
## Revenue Streams — Subscription Fees
- **These charges are imposed on customers who use or access a good or service, based on a formal agreement.**
    E.g.
    - Fitness and leisure clubs charge yearly membership fees.
    - Many credit card companies charge annual fees.
    - Telephone companies charge a basic service fee on a monthly basis but extra for additional services.
    - Cable and satellite television providers charge monthly fees.
## Revenue Streams — Merchandise
+ Service providers in the entertainment industry (such as cinemas, concerts, theatres and theme parks) rely on selling merchandise (such as popcorn, beverages, souvenirs and memorabilia) in addition to admissions charges.
## Revenue Streams — Dividends
- Being a shareholder of other companies entitles a business to payments of any declared dividends.
    E.g.
    - Europe's largest car maker Volkswagen holds shares in Porsche, Suzuki, and Scania (the Swedish maker of heavy trucks and buses).
## Revenue Streams — Donations
- These are financial gifts from individuals or other organizations to a business.
- Charities and non-profit organizations such as schools, hospitals and universities rely heavily on donations as a regular revenue stream.
