## Transfer Pricing $\rightarrow$ Tax Issues
### Governments around the world face problems in ensuring MNCs pay their due taxes mainly due to transfer pricing:

- Setting up offices in countries with low tax rates and claiming their profits are earned there.
- Some countries are encouraging MNCs to locate there by offering low rates of tax on profits, called 'sweetheart' deals. Whereas other countries where the sale really happens, fail to receive their tax revenue. E.g. **Apple, Cisco, Facebook (now Meta), Google** and **Microsoft** locating their sales subsidiary in Ireland (0.005% corporate tax) to record all their EU sales.
- Governments lose around **$200 billion** in tax revenue every year.
- Meanwhile, MNCs rely on public services such as transport and energy links, which are often paid for by the taxes of other organizations and individuals.
## Governments taking part-ownership of MNCs
- Governments of home countries have taken significant shareholdings in some of their MNCs in recent years.
- Governments earn a share of profits and gain some influence over the economies of other countries, which is a way of generating funds to replace the 'lost' tax revenues.
- Governments across the world owned almost **25%** of the Fortune Global 500 (the world's largest 500 companies measured by revenue earned) in 2017. (E.g. China's Sinopec and ICSC, Russia's Gazprom, France's Renault, Saudi Arabia's Aramco, etc...)
