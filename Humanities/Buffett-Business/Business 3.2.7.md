## The Uses to Which the Finance Is Put
**Some sources of finance are particularly suitable in certain situations:**
- A business that is seeking to raise finance to purchase property and has to rely on loan finance will probably consider taking out a mortgage loan, as it is a long-term large loan with relatively low-interest rates.
- A risky start-up may experience difficulties in finding investors willing to put capital into the business, therefore a business angel may be the best choice as they specialize in investing in relatively high-risk enterprises.
- An expanding business that may want to help pay suppliers promptly will use overdraft as a source of finance, since the funding will only be required for a short period of time until the business achieves an increased inflow of revenue which will automatically repay the overdraft.
