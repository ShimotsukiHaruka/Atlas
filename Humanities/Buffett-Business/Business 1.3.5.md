## Objectives And Business Decisions
**Decision-making involves:**
1. **Setting the objectives:** These should be S.M.A.R.T.
2. **Gathering information:** In order to analyze the situation, information on where a business is at the moment, what else is happening and what its options are is needed.
3. **Selecting a suitable strategy:** A business will decide on the best strategy to use; for example, targeting domestic or overseas markets.
4. **Implementing the strategy:** This is where the tactics come in to help devise the plan.
5. **Reviewing:** Considering whether the objectives are still appropriate, due to internal or external factors; a firm may need to set higher or different targets as a result.
## Business Objectives at Different Stages of Business Development
A firm’s objectives don’t remain the same forever. As market situations change (external factors) and as the business itself develops (internal factors), its objectives will change to reflect its current market and economic position. For example, a firm facing serious economic recession could change its objective from profit maximization to short term survival.
