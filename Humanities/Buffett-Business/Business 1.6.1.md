## Disadvantages to Host Country
- MNCs may be accused of imposing their culture on the host country, perhaps at the expense of the richness of local culture.
- Profits earned by MNCs may be remitted/sent back to the MNC's home country rather than being reinvested in the host economy.
- MNCs may make use of transfer pricing and other tax avoidance measures to reduce the profits on which they pay tax to the government in the host country.
- Domestic businesses may not be able to compete with MNC's efficiency, low costs, low prices and brand image, and may be forced to close shop.
- MNCs may not act ethically or in a socially responsible way, especially by taking advantage of weak countries that gain a lot from the MNCs presence in their country. For example, exploiting workers with low wages and poor working conditions in a country where labor laws are weak.
## Why Do Companies Want to Become Multinationals?

- **Easier access to markets:** To be able to sell in new markets by locating in them, or countries closer to them.
- **Lower logistics costs:** To reduce transport/distribution costs by producing nearer to markets.
- **Cheaper supplies:** To secure supplies of cheaper raw materials by avoiding controls on exporting them.
- **Cheaper labor:** Most often to take advantage of lower labor costs compared to the home country.
- **Overcoming barriers to trade:** To avoid protectionist policies that make exported products more expensive, such as **high tariffs, low quotas** or **currency devaluation.**
- **Reducing risk:** Having a second or third base can limit the damage from any disruption such as **political unrest, a pandemic** or a **natural disaster.**
## Transfer Pricing $\rightarrow$ Tax Issues
### Governments around the world face problems in ensuring MNCs pay their due taxes mainly due to transfer pricing:

- Setting up offices in countries with low tax rates and claiming their profits are earned there.
- Some countries are encouraging MNCs to locate there by offering low rates of tax on profits, called 'sweetheart' deals. Whereas other countries where the sale really happens, fail to receive their tax revenue. E.g. **Apple, Cisco, Facebook (now Meta), Google** and **Microsoft** locating their sales subsidiary in Ireland (0.005% corporate tax) to record all their EU sales.
- Governments lose around **$200 billion** in tax revenue every year.
- Meanwhile, MNCs rely on public services such as transport and energy links, which are often paid for by the taxes of other organizations and individuals.
## Governments taking part-ownership of MNCs
- Governments of home countries have taken significant shareholdings in some of their MNCs in recent years.
- Governments earn a share of profits and gain some influence over the economies of other countries, which is a way of generating funds to replace the 'lost' tax revenues.
- Governments across the world owned almost **25%** of the Fortune Global 500 (the world's largest 500 companies measured by revenue earned) in 2017. (E.g. China's Sinopec and ICSC, Russia's Gazprom, France's Renault, Saudi Arabia's Aramco, etc...)
