## Percentage Composition by Mass
$$\text{\% by mass} = A_r \times \frac{n}{M_r} \times 100$$
**Where:**
- $A_r$ = atomic mass of the element
- $n$ = number of moles of the element
- $M_r$ = molar mass of the compound

## Empirical Formula
1. Find the mass of each element in the compound.
2. Convert the mass of each element to moles using:$$n = \frac{m}{A_r}$$
3. Divide the number of moles of each element by the smallest number of moles calculated.
