## Overdraft
- An overdraft allows a business to temporarily overdraw on its bank account, i.e. to take out more money than it has in its account.
- Overdrafts are commonly used when businesses have minor cash flow problems (Unit 3.7).
- Although overdrafts can demand a relatively high rate of interest, they are usually more cost-effective than bank loans.
- This is because, unlike bank loans, overdrafts are used as short-term sources of finance and interest is charged on a daily basis.
- Overdrafts are suitable when there is a need for a large cash outflow such as:
    - retailers stocking up for peak trading periods.
    - businesses that have sold items on credit and are awaiting payments from their customers.
- However, a major disadvantage of overdrafts is that they are repayable on demand from the financial institution.
- Nevertheless, overdrafts provide flexibility for businesses that might occasionally face cash flow problems.
## Trade Credit
+ Trade credit allows a business to 'buy now and pay later'.
+ Although a sale is made at the time of purchase, the seller or credit provider does not receive any cash from the buyer until a later date.
+ Businesses/suppliers that offer trade credit (known as creditors) usually allow between 30-90 days for their customers (known as debtors) to pay.
## Crowdfunding
Crowdfunding is a source of finance that entails collecting relatively small amounts of money from a large number of supporters (the ‘crowd’).
- Crowdfunding is a welcome popular in recent years, especially after the financial crisis of 2008, when banks have been less willing to lend to small and medium-sized businesses, and savers were losing value of their savings over time.
- With the advent of the Internet, crowdfunding platforms have acted as a link between the 2 groups, publishing information on businesses seeking finance and administering loans provided by the ‘crowds’ of savers.
- Each saver lends a relatively small amount to any business in return for a product/service in the future; this limits the effect if the business fails to repay the loan.
