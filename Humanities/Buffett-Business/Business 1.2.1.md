## 4 Core Market Scenarios

### 1. High Demand, Low Price ($D \uparrow, P \downarrow$)

* **Scenario Type:** **Short-term Disequilibrium** or **Promotional Event**.
* **Analysis:** This is an unstable market state. Under normal economic laws, high demand would push prices up.
* **Causes:**
    * **Promotion/Price War:** A company is intentionally setting a low price to gain market share, despite high consumer interest.
    * **Market Inflexibility:** Prices have not yet adjusted to the sudden surge in demand (lag).
    * **Government Intervention:** Price controls or subsidies keep the price artificially low.
* **Outcome:** **Shortage** (Demand > Supply) will quickly ensue, forcing either price hikes or stock depletion.
### 2. Low Demand, Low Price ($D \downarrow, P \downarrow$)

* **Scenario Type:** **New Equilibrium at a Lower Level** or **Market Contraction**.
* **Analysis:** This aligns with the **Law of Demand**. When consumer interest drops, sellers must lower the price to encourage purchasing.
* **Causes:**
    * **Substitution Effect:** Consumers switch to a cheaper alternative product.
    * **Recession/Economic Downturn:** Consumers' purchasing power decreases.
    * **Obsolescence:** The product loses relevance (e.g., outdated technology).
* **Outcome:** Producers may reduce output ($S \downarrow$) or exit the market to achieve a new, lower equilibrium price and quantity.
### 3. High Supply, Low Price ($S \uparrow, P \downarrow$)

* **Scenario Type:** **Surplus (Overproduction)**.
* **Analysis:** This is a classic market imbalance where the quantity supplied exceeds demand. Producers must drop prices to clear excess inventory.
* **Causes:**
    * **Technological Advancement:** New technology lowers production costs, making it easy to produce more.
    * **New Entrants:** Many new competitors enter the market, collectively increasing $S$.
    * **Overestimation of Demand:** Producers anticipated higher demand than materialized.
* **Outcome:** A **Surplus** occurs. Prices will continue to fall until the lower price point stimulates enough new demand to reach equilibrium.
### 4. Low Supply, High Price ($S \downarrow, P \uparrow$)

* **Scenario Type:** **Shortage (Scarcity)**.
* **Analysis:** This is the result of scarcity, driving prices up as consumers compete for limited goods.
* **Causes:**
    * **Natural Disasters/External Shocks:** Events disrupt production or transportation.
    * **Increased Input Costs:** Raw materials become significantly more expensive, forcing producers to cut output and raise prices.
    * **Government Regulations:** New regulations restrict production volume.
* **Outcome:** A **Shortage** occurs. The high price may eventually incentivize more production or cause consumers to seek substitutes, slowly restoring balance.
