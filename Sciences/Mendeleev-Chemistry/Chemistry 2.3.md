## Percentage Composition by Mass
$$\text{\% by mass} = A_r \times \frac{n}{M_r} \times 100$$
**Where:**
- \( A_r \) = atomic mass of the element
- \( n \) = number of moles of the element
- \( M_r \) = molar mass of the compound

## Empirical Formula
1. Find the mass of each element in the compound.
2. Convert the mass of each element to moles using \( n = \frac{m}{A_r} \).
3. Divide the number of moles of each element by the smallest number of moles calculated.
