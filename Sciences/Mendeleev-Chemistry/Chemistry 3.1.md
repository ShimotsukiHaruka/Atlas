## Why Cl⁻ have high ionization energy than S²⁻ ? 
**Cause:**
*   Cl⁻ has the same number of electron shells (isoelectronic with S²⁻).
*   Cl⁻ has a greater nuclear charge (more protons) than S²⁻.

**Effect:**
*   The greater nuclear charge in Cl⁻ results in a stronger electrostatic attraction pulling the electron cloud closer to the nucleus.

**Consequence/Observation:**
*   The chloride ion (Cl⁻) has a smaller ionic radius than the sulfide ion (S²⁻).

## Homework
**Define the term first ionization energy and state what is meant by the term periodicity.**
+ **First ionization energy:** energy (in kJ mol⁻¹) to remove one electron from gaseous atom.
+ **Periodicity:** repeating pattern of (Chemistry and Physics) propties.
