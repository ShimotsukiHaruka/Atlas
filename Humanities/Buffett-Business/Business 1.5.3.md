## Integrations

***M&As and takeovers can happen in one of 3 ways:***

**Horizontal Integration:** integration of firms engaged in the production of the same type of good at the same level of production. Example: a cloth manufacturing company merges with another cloth manufacturing company.

**Vertical Integration:** integration of firms engaged in the production of the same type of good but at different levels of production (primary/secondary/tertiary). Example: a cloth manufacturing company (secondary sector) merges with a cotton growing firm (primary sector).

**Lateral/Conglomerate Integration:** this occurs when firms producing different types of products integrate. They could be at the same or different stages of production. Example: a housing company integrates with a dairy farm. Thus, the firm can produce a wide range of products.
