## Strategic Alliances
A Strategic Alliance (SA) is similar to a joint venture in that two or more businesses cooperate in a business venture for mutual benefit. Thus, as in the SA share the costs of product development, operations and marketing. However, unlike JVs, forming a strategic alliance means that the affiliated businesses remain independent organizations.

## 4 Key Stages to Form a Strategic Alliance
1. Feasibility study

   + Investigate and establish the rationale, objectives and feasibility of the SA.

2. Partnership assessment

   + Analyse the potential of different partners, such as what they have to offer to the alliance in terms of both human and financial resources and expertise.

3. Contract negotiation

   + Negotiations take place to determine each member's contributions and rewards, thus forming a mutually acceptable contract.

4. Implementation

   + Operations are initiated with commitment to the contract from all parties.

## Benefits of Joint Ventures

- **Synergies** : a JV can benefit from the pooling of experiences, skills and resources of the collaborating firms.
- **Spreading costs and risks** : Financial costs, risks and losses are shared in a JV thereby helping to reduce the financial burden on any single organization.
- **Entry to foreign markets** : JVs are used by companies to enter foreign countries markets by forming an agreement with local firms.
- **Relatively cheap:** Joint ventures are relatively cheap compared with the costs of a hostile takeover (which are often unknown). It is also easier to pull out of a JV if necessary.
- **High success rate:** Joint ventures tend to be friendly and receptive, thus more successful. By contrast, takeovers often fall due to their unfriendly and hostile nature.

## Difficulties of JVs and SAs

**There may still be difficulties, such as:**

- disagreements over the relative contribution of each business, and therefore how profits should be divided.

- different views on how decisions should be made and what the priorities are.

- different views on whether and how to end the venture.
