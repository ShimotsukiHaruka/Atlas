## 1. The "Define" Template (2 Marks)
**Goal:** Provide a precise textbook definition and a brief clarifying characteristic.
### Structure:
* **Definition:** "[Term] refers to..."
* **Characteristic/Purpose:** "It is characterized by..." or "Its main purpose is to..."
### Example (Q2b): Define *economies of scale*.
> **Economies of scale** refer to the cost advantages that a business obtains due to its scale of operation. They are typically measured by the amount of output and usually result in a decrease in the average unit cost as the scale of production increases.

---
## 2. The "Explain" Template (4 Marks)
**Goal:** Apply business theory to the specific case study using the **PEE** (Point, Explain, Evidence) structure.
### Structure (Repeat twice for "two" factors):
* **Point:** Identify the specific factor, source, or reason.
* **Explain:** Explain the theoretical mechanism (how it works in general).
* **Evidence/Application:** Connect directly to the case study (use names, data, or specific context).
### Example (Q1d): Explain *two* sources of finance for PI’s capital expenditure.
1. **Bank Loans:** This is an external source of finance where a lender provides a set amount of funds to be repaid with interest over a fixed period.
   * **Application:** Since PI is a "highly profitable" private limited company, it likely has the creditworthiness to secure a loan for its major 2019 forecasting expenditure.
2. **Retained Profit:** This is an internal source of finance where the profit kept by the company after taxes and dividends is reinvested into the business.
   * **Application:** PI is described as "highly profitable" with a forecast profit of $3,440,000 for 2019, which could be used to fund their capital equipment directly without incurring interest costs.

## 3. The "Distinguish" Template (4 Marks)
**Goal:** Clearly show the difference between two concepts by applying them to the case.
### Structure:
* **Concept A + Application:** Define Concept A and provide an example from the text.
* **Contrast Word:** Use "However," "In contrast," or "Unlike."
* **Concept B + Application:** Define Concept B and provide an example from the text.
### Example (Q3c): Distinguish between *internal* and *external* growth for WE.
> **Internal growth** occurs when a business expands using its own resources. For example, WE used its own "profits to increase production capacity" and expand its sales force. **In contrast, external growth** involves expansion through involvement with other organizations. This is seen in the text when WE decided to "diversify by taking over other regional businesses," such as a retail chain.

## 4. The "Discuss/Evaluate" Template (10 Marks)
**Goal:** Provide a balanced argument (Pros vs. Cons) ending in a reasoned judgment (Evaluation).

### Structure:

| Section               | Content Requirements                                                                               |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Introduction**      | Define the main term and state its relevance to the specific business in the case.                 |
| **Arguments FOR**     | 2 Points. Explain the benefits. **Must link to Case:** e.g., WE's "brand identity".                |
| **Arguments AGAINST** | 2 Points. Explain the drawbacks/risks. **Must link to Case:** e.g., WE's "falling profit margins". |
| **Conclusion**        | Use the **SLOT** method to provide a final recommendation.                                         |

### Evaluation Technique (SLOT):
* **S**hort vs. Long term: How does the impact change over time?
* **L**imitations: Is the data provided in the case sufficient or reliable?
* **O**pinions of Stakeholders: How do different groups (owners vs. employees) feel?
* **T**herefore: What is your final, justified recommendation?

### Example (Q3d): Discuss whether WE should retain its programme of CSR.
> **Introduction:** Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) involves businesses acting ethically towards stakeholders and the environment. For WE, CSR has been a core part of its brand identity since 2008.
>
> **Arguments For:** Retaining CSR maintains WE's "brand identity" and its appeal to "environmentally conscious customers." This loyalty allows them to remain a "regional market leader" despite competition.
>
> **Arguments Against:** However, WE is facing "falling profit margins," and as Milton Friedman argues, the primary responsibility of a business is to "increase its profits." CSR activities increase "one-off expenses" and might be unsustainable if profitability continues to decline due to "diseconomies of scale."
>
> **Conclusion:** In the **short term**, cutting CSR might improve margins. However, in the **long term**, WE's competitive advantage is built entirely on its ethical reputation. **Therefore**, WE should retain the programme but must optimize its operational costs to address the efficiency issues mentioned by the CEO.

In the actual exam, it should be written as a long paragraph.
