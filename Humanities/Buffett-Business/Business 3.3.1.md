## Cost and Revenue
Light industry VS Heavy industry (The differences in capital)
## Production Costs
+ Production costs refer to the costs a company incurs from manufacturing a product or providing a service that generates revenue.
+ Production costs can include a variety of expenses, such as labor, raw materials, consumable manufacturing supplies, and general overhead like rent and business rates.
$$Product\ Cost \ Formula=Direct \ Material \ Cost + Direct \ Labor \ Cost + Manufacturing \ Overhead \ Cost
$$ $$ATC=AVC+AFC$$
→Total costs can be determined by adding together the total direct materials and labor costs as well as the total manufacturing overhead costs.
## Total VS Average cost
$$ATC=\frac{TC}{Output}$$
## Fixed vs Variable Expenses

## Fixed Costs
- Fixed costs (FC) are costs that are fixed in the short-term running of a business and have to be paid even when no production is taking place.
- These costs do not depend on the amount of output produced.
- Examples: rent, interest on bank loans, telephone bills.
- Fixed Costs (FC) are sometimes referred to as overhead or indirect costs.
## Average Fixed Cost
- Average Fixed Cost (AFC) is the fixed cost per unit of output.

| Output | Total fixed cost ($) | Average fixed cost ($) |
| ------ | -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| 0      | 10                   | -                      |

**Table 22.2: Average fixed cost**
$$Average \ Fixed \ Cost \ (AFC) = \frac{Total \ Fixed \ Cost \ (TFC)}{Total \ Output}$$
## Variable Costs
- Variable costs (VC) are costs that are variable in the short-term running of a business and are paid according to the output produced.
- The more the production, the more the variable costs are.
- Examples: wages, electricity bill, cost of raw materials.
- Variable Costs (VC) are sometimes referred to as direct costs.
**The costs directly related to the sales volume of your business.**
- Delivery/shipping charges
- Sales commissions
- Advertising and publicity
