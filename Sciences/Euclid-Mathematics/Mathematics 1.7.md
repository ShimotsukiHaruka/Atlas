**The interquartile range (IQR) is a measure of statistical dispersion, or how spread out the values in a data set are. It is calculated as the difference between the third quartile (Q3) and the first quartile (Q1):**
+ **Mean** = Q3 - Q1
+ **Median** = (Q1 + Q3) / 2
+ **Mode** = The value that appears most frequently in a data set.
