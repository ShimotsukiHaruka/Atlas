## Direct Costs
Direct costs are the items of expenditure that can be evidently and explicitly associated with the output or sale of a particular product or business operation/ cost center.  
Direct costs may comprise of:
- Variable costs, such as direct raw materials and direct labor costs, or
- Fixed costs, such as third party motor insurance and depreciation costs for taxi drivers.  
    Rent can be another example of a direct cost if this fixed cost is for a production facility, producing one type of product.
For example, the direct costs of purchasing a commercial building may include:  
consultancy costs, telephone bills, printing costs, mortgage fees and bank charges.
## Variable Costs vs Direct Costs (Example)
- **Catering costs for a flight on a mainstream airline carrier, such as China Southern, would be classified as variable costs.**
    - This is because the more passengers on the airplane, the more food and drinks will be required since these are included in the ticket price.
- **However, for a ‘no-frills’ budget airline such as EasyJet and AirAsia, the catering costs are considered to be direct costs.**
    - The cost of food and drinks is directly related to the flight, but passengers do not all demand meals and drinks since these are paid for on an individual basis.
➔ *So direct costs, unlike variable costs, are not necessarily related to the level of output, they can be traced back to the output of a product and/or to a specific cost center.*
