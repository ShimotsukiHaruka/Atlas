# Physics 1.2
## Random and systematic errors
ðŸ”¹ Random errors
+ Cause: Uncontrollable fluctuations (e.g., parallax in reading, small environmental changes).

+ Effect: Values scatter above and below the true value.

+ Reduction:
  + Repeat measurements and take the mean.
  + Use more precise instruments.

ðŸ”¹ Systematic errors
+ Cause: Faulty methods or instruments (e.g., miscalibrated scale, zero error).

+ Effect: All values shifted in the same direction away from the true value.

+ Reduction:

   + Calibrate instruments.

   + Compare with known standards.

   + Improve experimental method.
### Precision and accuracy
+ **Precision** = how close repeated measurements are to each other (consistency), affected by random errors.
+ **Accuracy** = how close measurements are to the true value, affected by systematic errors.
+ **High precision, low accuracy** â†’ data clustered but far from true value.

+ **Low precision, high accuracy** â†’ average is correct, but spread is large.
### Absolute error
+ **Definition:** The uncertainty in a measurement.
+ **Single measurement:**
$$
Î”x = Â± \frac{1}{2} \times (\text{smallest instrument division})
$$
+ **Multiple measurements:**
$$
Î”x = Â± \frac{x_{\text{max}} - x_{\text{min}}}{2}
$$
### Vairty of errors
$$
Reative \ error=\frac{Î”x}{x}
$$
$$
Fractional Error=\frac{Absolute \ Error}{Measured \ Value}
$$ 
$$
Pesentage Error =\frac{Absolute \ Error}{Measured \ Value} \times 100\%
$$
