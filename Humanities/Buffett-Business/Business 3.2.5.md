## Leasing
**Advantages:**
- Cash released from leasing rather than purchasing can be used for the expenses within the business.
- Another benefit to the lessee is that repairs and maintenance are the responsibility of the lessor.
- Spending on leased assets is classed as a business expense, the tax bill of the lessee is reduced.

**Disadvantages:**
- In the long term, leasing is more expensive than hire purchase (effectively owning the asset after paying in installments over 12 or 24 months) or the outright purchase of the assets.
## Microfinance Providers
- Microfinance is a type of financial service aimed at entrepreneurs of small businesses, especially low and very low income clients.
- It includes other basic financial services such as savings, insurance and the transfer of money from high-income to lower-income countries.
- Microfinance providers enable the disadvantaged members of society to gain access to essential financial services to help eradicate poverty.
- The funds are approved for microenterprise development since access to banking and insurance services may be very limited for small businesses.
## Business Angels/Angel Investors
- These are extremely wealthy individuals who choose to invest their own money in businesses that offer high growth potential, i.e. high-risk, high-return business ventures.
- Business angels are likely to take a proactive role in the setting up or running of the business venture.
- Business angels provide funding for firms that are unable to secure loans from banks and/or too small to attract the attention of venture capitalists.
- With their wealth of experience and financial backing, angel investors can be a major advantage to the survival and success of a new business.
## Ba Criteria For Investment
Business angels look at a number of criteria before committing their capital in an investment project, including:
- Business plan: the long-term aim and purpose of the business venture creates direction and identity for the business, which is central to securing finance from investors.
- Return on investment: businesses need to show good potential to be highly profitable.
- People: success will only materialize if the business has a good team of skilled and talented people.
- Track record: Investors will assess the past track record of a business and its management before investing any capital. It can be an investigation into the firm’s ability to pay back previous lenders and the success record of the entrepreneurs.
