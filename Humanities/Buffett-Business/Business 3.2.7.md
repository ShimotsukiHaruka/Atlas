## The Uses to Which the Finance Is Put
**Some sources of finance are particularly suitable in certain situations:**
- A business that is seeking to raise finance to purchase property and has to rely on loan finance will probably consider taking out a mortgage loan, as it is a long-term large loan with relatively low-interest rates.
- A risky start-up may experience difficulties in finding investors willing to put capital into the business, therefore a business angel may be the best choice as they specialize in investing in relatively high-risk enterprises.
- An expanding business that may want to help pay suppliers promptly will use overdraft as a source of finance, since the funding will only be required for a short period of time until the business achieves an increased inflow of revenue which will automatically repay the overdraft.

##  Other Factors to Consider
- The business’s financial situation: If very profitable, it may be able to use retained profits, or at least be able to provide evidence to banks or other investors that it can repay loans.
- The business’s reputation: A reputation as a reliable and popular business may also enable its managers to persuade suppliers to offer increased trade credit, or assist in negotiating loans at favorable rates of interest, or in persuading shareholders to purchase more of the company’s shares.
- The business environment: If sales in a market are growing, a business’s revenues should increase, which may help it finance the repayments on a loan in full and on time. On the other hand, if interest rates are high, businesses may seek alternative sources of finance such as crowdfunding.
