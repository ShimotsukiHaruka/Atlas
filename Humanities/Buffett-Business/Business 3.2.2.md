## Share Capital
Share capital is the money raised from selling shares in the company.
A share is simply a certificate giving the holder ownership of part (or a share) of a company.
This is a long-term source of finance, as shown in a firm’s balance sheet (Unit 3.4) mostly for limited liability companies:
- Privately held companies can only sell their shares privately to relatives or friends.
- Publicly held companies can sell their shares to the public via a stock exchange.
The key advantage is that it can provide a huge amount of finance.
The key disadvantage is that it can lead to a loss of control and ownership, and a hostile takeover is very much possible.
