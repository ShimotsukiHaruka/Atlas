## The Shareholder Concept
As we have seen, businesses have certain legal responsibilities to their stakeholders. For example, there are laws controlling the ways in which businesses can promote their products and, for food manufacturers, the ingredients that can be used. Some businesses simply do what they have to by law and no more. They focus mainly on rewarding their owners. They will pay employees what they need to get the job done, but do not think they have any more responsibilities other than this. They will try to get the lowest price for supplies, perhaps by threatening to use different suppliers and bargaining hard. They will pay governments the taxes they have to but will not think they have any obligation to invest more in their region or country. This approach which regards rewarding owners as the key business objective is known as the shareholder concept.
## The Stakeholder Concept
Many organizations are now trying to work with their stakeholders and regard them much more as partners. This cooperative approach is known as the stakeholder concept. This view believes that it is better in the long-term to treat stakeholders well.
**For example:**
+ Working closely with suppliers and paying them a fair reward for their work (even if this is more than the business would have to pay) can lead to better quality supplies and much greater flexibility by suppliers to help out when needed.
+ Focusing on employees’ careers and showing concern about their welfare could lead to greater loyalty and commitment and, as a result, a better quality of work.
+ Being interested in the environment could help save costs through initiatives such as recycling, but also make the business more attractive to employees, customers and investors.

The stakeholder concept fits in with corporate social responsibility in that it stresses the benefits of accepting obligations to stakeholders over and above what the law requires.
## Conflicts Between Stakeholders
+ Employees, senior managers and directors may demand higher wages or larger bonuses, which raises production costs so can reduce the amount of profits from which shareholders receive dividend payments.

+ Shareholders may demand regular and higher dividend payments, but this may result in less retained profits available for production and marketing managers to improve.

+ Customers may want lower prices, but this reduces the firm’s profit margin so can upset the company’s shareholders.

+ Employers may want greater efficiency and productivity gains by investing in new technologies, but this might create job losses for employees.

+ The local community demands businesses operate in a socially responsible way and create jobs in the local area, but this can create congestion and noise and air pollution in the local area, thereby upsetting other members of the community.
