## Overdraft
- An overdraft allows a business to temporarily overdraw on its bank account, i.e. to take out more money than it has in its account.
- Overdrafts are commonly used when businesses have minor cash flow problems (Unit 3.7).
- Although overdrafts can demand a relatively high rate of interest, they are usually more cost-effective than bank loans.
- This is because, unlike bank loans, overdrafts are used as short-term sources of finance and interest is charged on a daily basis.
