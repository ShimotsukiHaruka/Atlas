## Sources of finance
"If you owe your bank a hundred pounds, you have a problem. But if you owe a million, it has."
## Internal sources of finance
Internal sources of finance come from **within** the business using its own resources. These include:
- Personal funds
- Retained profits
- Sale of assets
## Personal funds
- Sole traders and partners are likely to use their own personal funds from their savings or contract a personal loan in order to finance the start-up of their business.
- Friends and family may invest their personal funds into their business, perhaps in return for part-ownership, which may be organized through the creation of a privately held company and by offering shares to those investing funds.
- Sole traders and partners who do not invest or risk any of their personal funds are highly unlikely to secure loans or finance for their business activity.
## Retained profit
+ Retained profit is the value of profits that the business keeps (after paying taxes to the government and dividends to its shareholders) to use/reinvest within the business.
+ Retained profit is often used for purchasing and/or upgrading fixed assets.
+ Some retained profit might also be kept in a contingency fund in case of emergencies and unforeseeable expenditure in the future.
+ The benefit of retained profit as a source of finance is that it does not incur any interest charges.
## Sale of Assets
- **Businesses in need of finance can**:
    - Sell some of their fixed assets, especially their dormant assets (unused assets).
    - Sell old/obsolete assets in order to purchase newer ones.
    - Choose to relocate and sell their land, factories and buildings.
    - Sell some of their fixed assets to survive a liquidity problem, and then lease them back so that their business is not disrupted.
